### Computational Thinking
"Cows and bulls" is a classic word guessing game, asked ChatGPT to write a program  where the computer plays cows and bulls against the user and guesses the word while the users only provides the computer with input of cows and bulls for four letter words. 
The four letter words were given as a text file from https://gist.github.com/paulcc/3799331

### Yahtzee
Used ChatGPT to learn what a game of Yahtzee is and played the game with it. Asked it to come up with an approach of how to write a Yahtzee scorer. Then wrote the code and implemented a testing strategy for the Yahtzee code using ChatGPT.

### Markov Chains
Implemented a Markov chain model for text completion using ChatGPT, iterated upon the solution and tested it against different testcases.
