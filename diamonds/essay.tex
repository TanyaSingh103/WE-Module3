\section{Introduction}
"Explain it like you are explaining it to a five year old", is actually harder than I initially thought. I mean, explaining a card game to a five year old would be pretty difficult, given their fleeting attention span. So thankfully, instead of a five year old, I had to explain the card game to ChatGPT.

\section{Problem Statement}
My job was to explain to ChatGPT what the game of "Diamonds" is, basically to teach the rules of the game to it and, hopefully manage to get it to write working code that can be understood by a person.

The task in a sense, was to to "teach" GenAI something that was not known to it before hand, to get it utilize bits of information from different sources to generate ideas that might be related to other things but are "new" in the given context.
