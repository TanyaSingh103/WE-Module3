You: 
- tell me what you know about shannon fano encoding

ChatGPT: 
- Shannon-Fano encoding is a method used in data compression, particularly in the context of information theory. It is one of the earliest techniques developed to encode data in a way that reduces redundancy and compresses the size of the data. Here's a detailed overview of Shannon-Fano encoding:
### Concept

Shannon-Fano encoding is a variable-length, prefix-free coding scheme, meaning that no encoded symbol is a prefix of another encoded symbol. It is designed based on the probabilities of the symbols in the source data, where more frequent symbols are given shorter codes, and less frequent symbols are given longer codes.
### Algorithm

The Shannon-Fano algorithm involves the following steps: 
1. **List Symbols and Probabilities** : List the symbols that need to be encoded along with their probabilities or frequencies of occurrence. 
2. **Sort** : Sort the symbols in decreasing order of their probabilities. 
3. **Divide** : Split the list into two parts, as equal in total probability as possible. 
4. **Assign Codes** : Assign a binary digit (0 or 1) to each part. For example, one part gets 0 and the other part gets 1. 
5. **Recurse** : Recursively apply the same procedure to each part until each symbol has a unique code.
### Example

Consider the following symbols and their probabilities:
- A: 0.4
- B: 0.3
- C: 0.2
- D: 0.1

The encoding process would be as follows: 
1. **Sort** : The symbols are already sorted by probability. 
2. **Divide** : Split into two groups:
- Group 1: {A, B} with total probability 0.7
- Group 2: {C, D} with total probability 0.3 
3. **Assign Codes** :
- Group 1 gets '0'
- Group 2 gets '1' 
4. **Recurse** : 
- For Group 1: Split {A, B}
- A: 0 -> 00
- B: 1 -> 01 
- For Group 2: Split {C, D}
- C: 0 -> 10
- D: 1 -> 11

The resulting codes are:
- A: 00
- B: 01
- C: 10
- D: 11
### Properties 
- **Prefix-Free** : No code is a prefix of another, ensuring that the encoded message can be uniquely decoded. 
- **Not Optimal** : Although Shannon-Fano encoding is effective, it is not always optimal. Huffman coding, which came later, often results in better compression rates for the same data because it always produces an optimal prefix code given the symbol probabilities.
### Comparison with Huffman Coding

Huffman coding and Shannon-Fano encoding are both greedy algorithms for creating prefix codes based on symbol probabilities. However, Huffman coding generally produces better compression because it uses a different method for constructing the code tree: 
- **Huffman Coding** : Constructs the code tree by repeatedly merging the two least probable symbols, ensuring optimality. 
- **Shannon-Fano Encoding** : Divides the symbols into two groups with as equal probabilities as possible, which does not always yield the optimal code length.
### Applications

While Shannon-Fano encoding has largely been supplanted by more efficient algorithms like Huffman coding and arithmetic coding, it remains an important concept in the study of data compression and information theory. It laid the groundwork for later developments and is still useful for educational purposes to understand the basics of entropy and source coding.

In summary, Shannon-Fano encoding is a fundamental but non-optimal method for data compression that allocates shorter codes to more frequent symbols and longer codes to less frequent symbols, based on their probabilities.

You: 
- are you really splitting the list into two parts, as equal in total probability as possible? You put A and B together which is 0.7 whereas C and D together is just 0.3, isn't it better to have A on one side as 0.4 and B, C and D on the other as 0.6?

2 / 2

ChatGPT: 
- You are correct. In Shannon-Fano encoding, the goal is to split the list into two parts with as equal total probabilities as possible. The example provided did not adhere to this rule accurately. Let's correct the example to reflect a more balanced split based on the total probabilities.
### Corrected Example

Consider the following symbols and their probabilities:
- A: 0.4
- B: 0.3
- C: 0.2
- D: 0.1

The encoding process would be as follows: 
1. **List and Sort** : The symbols are already sorted by probability. 
2. **Divide** : Split into two groups as equal in total probability as possible:
- Group 1: {A} with total probability 0.4
- Group 2: {B, C, D} with total probability 0.6 
3. **Assign Codes** :
- Group 1 gets '0'
- Group 2 gets '1' 
4. **Recurse** :
- For Group 1: A is the only symbol, so its code is '0'. 
- For Group 2: Split {B, C, D} into two groups:
- Group 2.1: {B} with total probability 0.3
- Group 2.2: {C, D} with total probability 0.3 
- Assign codes to Group 2:
- Group 2.1 gets '10'
- Group 2.2 gets '11' 
- Recurse for Group 2.2: 
- Split {C, D} into two groups:
- C: 0.2
- D: 0.1 
- Assign codes:
- C gets '110'
- D gets '111'

The resulting codes are:
- A: 0
- B: 10
- C: 110
- D: 111
### Step-by-Step Breakdown 
1. **Initial List and Sort** :
- A: 0.4
- B: 0.3
- C: 0.2
- D: 0.1 
2. **First Split** :
- Group 1: {A} (0.4)
- Group 2: {B, C, D} (0.6) 
3. **Second Split**  (for Group 2):
- Group 2.1: {B} (0.3)
- Group 2.2: {C, D} (0.3) 
4. **Third Split**  (for Group 2.2):
- Group 2.2.1: {C} (0.2)
- Group 2.2.2: {D} (0.1)
### Final Codes
- A: 0
- B: 10
- C: 110
- D: 111

This corrected process ensures that the groups are split with as equal total probabilities as possible, which is the key principle of Shannon-Fano encoding.

You: 
- okay now what would the shannon fano encoding tree look like for this example?

ChatGPT: 
- To construct the Shannon-Fano encoding tree for the symbols and probabilities given, we need to follow the recursive splitting process and create a binary tree representation. Here is the step-by-step construction of the Shannon-Fano encoding tree:
### Symbols and Probabilities
- A: 0.4
- B: 0.3
- C: 0.2
- D: 0.1
### Step-by-Step Tree Construction 
1. **Initial Split** : 
- Split the list into two parts with as equal total probability as possible:
- Group 1: {A} with total probability 0.4
- Group 2: {B, C, D} with total probability 0.6 
- Assign binary codes:
- Group 1: 0
- Group 2: 1 
2. **Second Split**  (for Group 2): 
- Split {B, C, D} into two parts:
- Group 2.1: {B} with total probability 0.3
- Group 2.2: {C, D} with total probability 0.3 
- Assign binary codes:
- Group 2.1: 10
- Group 2.2: 11 
3. **Third Split**  (for Group 2.2): 
- Split {C, D} into two parts:
- Group 2.2.1: {C} with total probability 0.2
- Group 2.2.2: {D} with total probability 0.1 
- Assign binary codes:
- Group 2.2.1: 110
- Group 2.2.2: 111

```


### Final Codes from the Tree
- A: 0
- B: 10
- C: 110
- D: 111
### Explanation 
- **Root** : The root node represents the entire set of symbols. 
- **First Level** : The set is split into two groups:
- Group 1 (left branch): {A} with a code of '0'.
- Group 2 (right branch): {B, C, D} with a prefix code of '1'. 
- **Second Level** : Group 2 is further split into:
- Group 2.1 (left branch): {B} with a prefix code of '10'.
- Group 2.2 (right branch): {C, D} with a prefix code of '11'. 
- **Third Level** : Group 2.2 is split into:
- Group 2.2.1 (left branch): {C} with a code of '110'.
- Group 2.2.2 (right branch): {D} with a code of '111'.

This tree visually represents the Shannon-Fano encoding process, where each leaf node corresponds to a symbol and its associated binary code.

You: 
- okay, now given a list of tuples, each tuple having a character and it's probability, I want you to write a program that generates the shannon fano encoding tree for that list using the exact steps used just now

ChatGPT: 
- Sure, I can help you with that. Here's a Python program that generates the Shannon-Fano encoding tree for a given list of tuples where each tuple contains a character and its probability. This program follows the exact steps used earlier:

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value
        self.left = None
        self.right = None

def shannon_fano_encoding(symbol_probabilities):
    # Sort symbols by probability in descending order
    sorted_symbols = sorted(symbol_probabilities, key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
    # Construct Shannon-Fano encoding tree
    return construct_tree(sorted_symbols)

def construct_tree(symbols):
    if len(symbols) == 1:
        return Node(symbols[0][0])  # Return single node for single symbol
    elif len(symbols) == 0:
        return None

    # Find the split index with as equal total probability as possible
    total_probability = sum(prob for _, prob in symbols)
    cumulative_probability = 0
    split_index = 0
    for i, (_, prob) in enumerate(symbols):
        cumulative_probability += prob
        if cumulative_probability * 2 >= total_probability:
            split_index = i
            break

    # Recursively construct left and right subtrees
    node = Node(None)
    node.left = construct_tree(symbols[:split_index + 1])
    node.right = construct_tree(symbols[split_index + 1:])
    return node

def print_tree(node, code=''):
    if node is not None:
        if node.value is not None:
            print(f"{node.value}: {code}")
        print_tree(node.left, code + '0')
        print_tree(node.right, code + '1')

# Example usage:
symbol_probabilities = [('A', 0.4), ('B', 0.3), ('C', 0.2), ('D', 0.1)]
root = shannon_fano_encoding(symbol_probabilities)
print("Shannon-Fano Encoding Tree:")
print_tree(root)
```



This program defines a `Node` class to represent nodes in the tree and provides functions `shannon_fano_encoding` to generate the tree and `print_tree` to print the codes associated with each symbol. You can provide your list of tuples to the `symbol_probabilities` variable and run the program to get the Shannon-Fano encoding tree.

You: 
- the split is not working right, it is again splitting A and B together

ChatGPT: 
- You're correct; I apologize for the oversight. Let me correct that. We need to find the optimal split point in the sorted list of symbols such that the total probabilities are approximately equal on both sides. Here's the corrected version of the code:

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value
        self.left = None
        self.right = None

def shannon_fano_encoding(symbol_probabilities):
    # Sort symbols by probability in descending order
    sorted_symbols = sorted(symbol_probabilities, key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
    # Construct Shannon-Fano encoding tree
    return construct_tree(sorted_symbols)

def construct_tree(symbols):
    if len(symbols) == 1:
        return Node(symbols[0][0])  # Return single node for single symbol
    elif len(symbols) == 0:
        return None

    # Find the split index with as equal total probability as possible
    total_probability = sum(prob for _, prob in symbols)
    cumulative_probability = 0
    split_index = 0
    min_difference = total_probability
    for i, (_, prob) in enumerate(symbols):
        cumulative_probability += prob
        difference = abs(2 * cumulative_probability - total_probability)
        if difference < min_difference:
            min_difference = difference
            split_index = i

    # Recursively construct left and right subtrees
    node = Node(None)
    node.left = construct_tree(symbols[:split_index + 1])
    node.right = construct_tree(symbols[split_index + 1:])
    return node

def print_tree(node, code=''):
    if node is not None:
        if node.value is not None:
            print(f"{node.value}: {code}")
        print_tree(node.left, code + '0')
        print_tree(node.right, code + '1')

# Example usage:
symbol_probabilities = [('A', 0.4), ('B', 0.3), ('C', 0.2), ('D', 0.1)]
root = shannon_fano_encoding(symbol_probabilities)
print("Shannon-Fano Encoding Tree:")
print_tree(root)
```



In this corrected version, the `construct_tree` function iterates through the sorted symbols list and finds the split index that minimizes the difference between the cumulative probabilities of the two groups. This ensures that the split is made with as equal total probability as possible.




3.5

You: 
- maybe split construct_tree into smaller functions

ChatGPT: 
- Sure, breaking down the `construct_tree` function into smaller functions can improve readability and maintainability. Here's the updated code with `construct_tree` split into smaller functions:

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value
        self.left = None
        self.right = None

def shannon_fano_encoding(symbol_probabilities):
    sorted_symbols = sorted(symbol_probabilities, key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
    return construct_tree(sorted_symbols)

def find_split_index(symbols, total_probability):
    cumulative_probability = 0
    split_index = 0
    min_difference = total_probability
    for i, (_, prob) in enumerate(symbols):
        cumulative_probability += prob
        difference = abs(2 * cumulative_probability - total_probability)
        if difference < min_difference:
            min_difference = difference
            split_index = i
    return split_index

def construct_tree(symbols):
    if len(symbols) == 1:
        return Node(symbols[0][0])  
    elif len(symbols) == 0:
        return None

    total_probability = sum(prob for _, prob in symbols)
    split_index = find_split_index(symbols, total_probability)

    node = Node(None)
    node.left = construct_tree(symbols[:split_index + 1])
    node.right = construct_tree(symbols[split_index + 1:])
    return node

def print_tree(node, code=''):
    if node is not None:
        if node.value is not None:
            print(f"{node.value}: {code}")
        print_tree(node.left, code + '0')
        print_tree(node.right, code + '1')

# Example usage:
symbol_probabilities = [('A', 0.4), ('B', 0.3), ('C', 0.2), ('D', 0.1)]
root = shannon_fano_encoding(symbol_probabilities)
print("Shannon-Fano Encoding Tree:")
print_tree(root)
```



In this version, `find_split_index` is a separate function responsible for finding the split index with as equal total probability as possible, while `construct_tree` handles the overall construction of the tree. This separation makes the code more modular and easier to understand.




3.5

You: 
- also is it okay to use a ascending sort instead of a descending one?

ChatGPT: 
- Yes, using either ascending or descending sorting order is acceptable for Shannon-Fano encoding, as long as you handle the split point accordingly.

When sorting in ascending order, you would typically start with the smallest probabilities and then recursively split the list, assigning '0' and '1' to the left and right branches, respectively. The split point would be chosen to minimize the difference in cumulative probabilities on both sides.

Here's how you can adjust the code to use ascending sorting order:

```python
def shannon_fano_encoding(symbol_probabilities):
    sorted_symbols = sorted(symbol_probabilities, key=lambda x: x[1])  # Sort in ascending order
    return construct_tree(sorted_symbols)

def find_split_index(symbols, total_probability):
    cumulative_probability = 0
    split_index = 0
    min_difference = total_probability
    for i, (_, prob) in enumerate(symbols):
        cumulative_probability += prob
        difference = abs(2 * cumulative_probability - total_probability)
        if difference < min_difference:
            min_difference = difference
            split_index = i
    return split_index

# The rest of the code remains the same...
```



In this version, the symbols are sorted in ascending order of probabilities. The `find_split_index` function still works as before to find the optimal split point, but now it operates on the ascending-sorted list. The rest of the code remains unchanged.

So, yes, using ascending sorting order is perfectly fine for Shannon-Fano encoding.




3.5

You: 
- I changed the print function to this:

def print_tree(node, code=''):
    if node is not None:
        print_tree(node.right, code + '1')
        if node.value is not None:
            print(f"{node.value}: {code}")
        print_tree(node.left, code + '0')

Now it will print A first, can you see what I changed?


4 / 4

ChatGPT: 
- Yes, I see the change you made. You swapped the order of printing the left and right subtrees in the `print_tree` function. Specifically, you moved the printing of the right subtree before printing the current node's value and then printing the left subtree.

Here's the comparison:

Original `print_tree` function:

```python
def print_tree(node, code=''):
    if node is not None:
        if node.value is not None:
            print(f"{node.value}: {code}")
        print_tree(node.left, code + '0')
        print_tree(node.right, code + '1')
```



Your modified `print_tree` function:

```python
def print_tree(node, code=''):
    if node is not None:
        print_tree(node.right, code + '1')
        if node.value is not None:
            print(f"{node.value}: {code}")
        print_tree(node.left, code + '0')
```



Your change effectively reverses the traversal order, making the function print nodes in a right-root-left order instead of the original left-root-right order. This adjustment results in the tree being printed in a mirrored fashion, which can change the order in which nodes are displayed.




3.5

You: 
- now what's the complete modified code/

ChatGPT: 
- Here's the complete modified code with your adjusted `print_tree` function:

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value
        self.left = None
        self.right = None

def shannon_fano_encoding(symbol_probabilities):
    sorted_symbols = sorted(symbol_probabilities, key=lambda x: x[1])  # Sort in ascending order
    return construct_tree(sorted_symbols)

def find_split_index(symbols, total_probability):
    cumulative_probability = 0
    split_index = 0
    min_difference = total_probability
    for i, (_, prob) in enumerate(symbols):
        cumulative_probability += prob
        difference = abs(2 * cumulative_probability - total_probability)
        if difference < min_difference:
            min_difference = difference
            split_index = i
    return split_index

def construct_tree(symbols):
    if len(symbols) == 1:
        return Node(symbols[0][0])  
    elif len(symbols) == 0:
        return None

    total_probability = sum(prob for _, prob in symbols)
    split_index = find_split_index(symbols, total_probability)

    node = Node(None)
    node.left = construct_tree(symbols[:split_index + 1])
    node.right = construct_tree(symbols[split_index + 1:])
    return node

def print_tree(node, code=''):
    if node is not None:
        print_tree(node.right, code + '1')
        if node.value is not None:
            print(f"{node.value}: {code}")
        print_tree(node.left, code + '0')

# Example usage:
symbol_probabilities = [('A', 0.4), ('B', 0.3), ('C', 0.2), ('D', 0.1)]
root = shannon_fano_encoding(symbol_probabilities)
print("Shannon-Fano Encoding Tree:")
print_tree(root)
```



With this modification, the `print_tree` function now prints the nodes in a right-root-left order, resulting in a mirrored display compared to the original left-root-right order.




3.5

You: 
- [('A', 0.49), ('B', 0.14), ('C', 0.14), ('D', 0.07), ('E', 0.07), ('F', 0.04), ('G', 0.02), ('H', 0.02), ('I', 0.01)]
for a case like this one, there are equal probabilities for some characters, for such cases, would there be some difference in expected and actual output?

ChatGPT: 
- In cases where there are equal probabilities for some characters, the Shannon-Fano encoding algorithm may produce different results depending on how the split points are determined. If the total probability is evenly divisible into two groups, the algorithm may choose different split points, resulting in different encoding trees.

In the provided case, where there are equal probabilities for characters 'D' and 'E', and also for 'G' and 'H', the algorithm may produce different trees depending on how it handles these ties. Here's an example of how the trees might differ:
### Original Data:
- A: 0.49
- B: 0.14
- C: 0.14
- D: 0.07
- E: 0.07
- F: 0.04
- G: 0.02
- H: 0.02
- I: 0.01
### Possible Split Options for (D, E) and (G, H):
1. (D, E) together, (G, H) together
2. (D, E) separated, (G, H) together
3. (D, E) together, (G, H) separated
4. (D, E) separated, (G, H) separated

Each of these options may lead to a slightly different encoding tree, which could result in different outputs. However, the overall compression efficiency should be comparable, as the total number of bits used for encoding will be similar.

To ensure consistency in the output, you might need to establish a deterministic way of handling such ties, for example, by specifying a tie-breaking rule based on the order of appearance in the sorted list or by prioritizing certain characters over others. This way, you can ensure that the output remains consistent across different runs of the algorithm.

You: 
- do you know about the tree plot python library?

6 / 6

ChatGPT: 
- Yes, I'm familiar with Python libraries for plotting trees, such as `matplotlib` and `graphviz`. Both of these libraries can be used to visualize trees, including Shannon-Fano encoding trees.

Here's a brief overview of each: 
1. **Matplotlib** : Matplotlib is a comprehensive library for creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations in Python. While not specifically designed for tree plotting, it can be used to create basic tree visualizations. However, it requires more manual configuration to create tree diagrams compared to specialized tree plotting libraries. 
2. **Graphviz** : Graphviz is a powerful open-source graph visualization software. The `graphviz` Python library provides a simple interface for creating and rendering graphs, including trees. It offers various layout algorithms and supports exporting the visualizations to various formats, such as PNG, PDF, or SVG. Graphviz is commonly used for visualizing complex graphs and trees due to its flexibility and ease of use for tree visualization tasks.

Would you like more information on how to use one of these libraries to plot a tree?

You: 
- I want to use matplotlib to plot the shnnon fano tree output that is given by the program just created

ChatGPT: 
- Sure, you can use Matplotlib to plot the Shannon-Fano encoding tree generated by the program we created earlier. Here's how you can modify the code to generate a basic tree plot using Matplotlib:

First, make sure you have Matplotlib installed (`pip install matplotlib`).

Then, you can use the following code:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

class Node:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value
        self.left = None
        self.right = None

def shannon_fano_encoding(symbol_probabilities):
    sorted_symbols = sorted(symbol_probabilities, key=lambda x: x[1])  # Sort in ascending order
    return construct_tree(sorted_symbols)

def find_split_index(symbols, total_probability):
    cumulative_probability = 0

        if node.right is not None:
            plt.plot([x, x + spacing], [y - 1, y - spacing], marker='o', color='b')
            plot_tree(node.right, x + spacing, y - spacing, spacing / 2)

# Example usage:

This code will generate a basic plot of the Shannon-Fano encoding tree using Matplotlib. Each node in the tree is represented by its character value, and edges connect parent nodes to their children. You can adjust the spacing between nodes and other parameters as needed to improve the appearance of the plot.

You: 
- make the labels bigger

ChatGPT: 
- You can increase the size of the labels in the plot by specifying the `fontsize` parameter in the `plt.text` function. Here's the modified code with larger labels:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

class Node:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value
        self.left = None
        self.right = None

def shannon_fano_encoding(symbol_probabilities):
    sorted_symbols = sorted(symbol_probabilities, key=lambda x: x[1])  # Sort in ascending order
    return construct_tree(sorted_symbols)

def find_split_index(symbols, total_probability):
    cumulative_probability = 0
    split_index = 0
    min_difference = total_probability
    for i, (_, prob) in enumerate(symbols):
        cumulative_probability += prob
        difference = abs(2 * cumulative_probability - total_probability)
        if difference < min_difference:
            min_difference = difference
            split_index = i
    return split_index

def construct_tree(symbols):
    if len(symbols) == 1:
        return Node(symbols[0][0])  
    elif len(symbols) == 0:

    total_probability = sum(prob for _, prob in symbols)
    split_index = find_split_index(symbols, total_probability)

    node = Node(None)
    node.left = construct_tree(symbols[:split_index + 1])
    node.right = construct_tree(symbols[split_index + 1:])
    return node

def plot_tree(node, x=0, y=0, spacing=20):
    if node is not None:
        plt.text(x, y, str(node.value), style='italic', fontsize=14)  # Increase fontsize
        if node.left is not None:
            plt.plot([x, x - spacing], [y - 1, y - spacing], marker='o', color='b')
            plot_tree(node.left, x - spacing, y - spacing, spacing / 2)
        if node.right is not None:
            plt.plot([x, x + spacing], [y - 1, y - spacing], marker='o', color='b')
            plot_tree(node.right, x + spacing, y - spacing, spacing / 2)

# Example usage:
symbol_probabilities = [('A', 0.49), ('B', 0.14), ('C', 0.14), ('D', 0.07), ('E', 0.07), ('F', 0.04), ('G', 0.02), ('H', 0.02), ('I', 0.01)]

plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
plot_tree(root)
plt.title("Shannon-Fano Encoding Tree")
plt.axis('off')
plt.show()
```



In this version, I've set the `fontsize` parameter in the `plt.text` function to 14 to make the labels larger. You can adjust the value as needed to achieve the desired label size.

You: 
- also the nodes at the end are looking slightly overlapped, maybe adjust scale?

ChatGPT: 
- To prevent the nodes from overlapping at the end of the branches, you can adjust the scale of the plot by increasing the spacing between nodes. Here's how you can modify the code to achieve that:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

class Node:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value
        self.left = None
        self.right = None

def shannon_fano_encoding(symbol_probabilities):
    sorted_symbols = sorted(symbol_probabilities, key=lambda x: x[1])  # Sort in ascending order
    return construct_tree(sorted_symbols)

def find_split_index(symbols, total_probability):
    cumulative_probability = 0
    split_index = 0
    min_difference = total_probability
    for i, (_, prob) in enumerate(symbols):
        cumulative_probability += prob
        difference = abs(2 * cumulative_probability - total_probability)
        if difference < min_difference:
            min_difference = difference
            split_index = i
    return split_index

def construct_tree(symbols):
    if len(symbols) == 1:
        return Node(symbols[0][0])  
    elif len(symbols) == 0:
        return None

    total_probability = sum(prob for _, prob in symbols)
    split_index = find_split_index(symbols, total_probability)

    node = Node(None)
    node.left = construct_tree(symbols[:split_index + 1])
    node.right = construct_tree(symbols[split_index + 1:])
    return node

def plot_tree(node, x=0, y=0, spacing=30):  # Increased spacing
    if node is not None:
        plt.text(x, y, str(node.value), style='italic', fontsize=14)
        if node.left is not None:
            plt.plot([x, x - spacing], [y - 1, y - spacing], marker='o', color='b')
            plot_tree(node.left, x - spacing, y - spacing, spacing * 0.8)  # Adjusted spacing
        if node.right is not None:
            plt.plot([x, x + spacing], [y - 1, y - spacing], marker='o', color='b')
            plot_tree(node.right, x + spacing, y - spacing, spacing * 0.8)  # Adjusted spacing

# Example usage:

root = shannon_fano_encoding(symbol_probabilities)
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))  # Increased figure size
plot_tree(root)
plt.title("Shannon-Fano Encoding Tree")
plt.axis('off')
plt.show()
```



In this version, I've increased the spacing between nodes in the `plot_tree` function and adjusted the figure size to accommodate the larger spacing. This should help prevent the nodes from overlapping at the end of the branches. You can further adjust the spacing as needed to optimize the layout of the tree.




3.5

You: 
- some labels are showing None because those nodes don't have values, instead of None, display nothing or " "

ChatGPT: 
- To display nothing instead of "None" for nodes without values, you can modify the `plot_tree` function to check if the node's value is `None` before plotting the text. Here's how you can do it:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

class Node:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value
        self.left = None
        self.right = None

def shannon_fano_encoding(symbol_probabilities):
    sorted_symbols = sorted(symbol_probabilities, key=lambda x: x[1])  # Sort in ascending order
    return construct_tree(sorted_symbols)

def find_split_index(symbols, total_probability):
    cumulative_probability = 0
    split_index = 0
    min_difference = total_probability
    for i, (_, prob) in enumerate(symbols):
        cumulative_probability += prob
        difference = abs(2 * cumulative_probability - total_probability)
        if difference < min_difference:
            min_difference = difference
            split_index = i
    return split_index

def construct_tree(symbols):
    if len(symbols) == 1:
        return Node(symbols[0][0])  
    elif len(symbols) == 0:
        return None

    total_probability = sum(prob for _, prob in symbols)
    split_index = find_split_index(symbols, total_probability)

    node = Node(None)
    node.left = construct_tree(symbols[:split_index + 1])
    node.right = construct_tree(symbols[split_index + 1:])
    return node

def plot_tree(node, x=0, y=0, spacing=30):
    if node is not None:
        if node.value is not None:  # Check if node value is not None
            plt.text(x, y, str(node.value), style='italic', fontsize=14)
        if node.left is not None:
            plt.plot([x, x - spacing], [y - 1, y - spacing], marker='o', color='b')
            plot_tree(node.left, x - spacing, y - spacing, spacing * 0.8)
        if node.right is not None:
            plt.plot([x, x + spacing], [y - 1, y - spacing], marker='o', color='b')
            plot_tree(node.right, x + spacing, y - spacing, spacing * 0.8)

# Example usage:
symbol_probabilities = [('A', 0.49), ('B', 0.14), ('C', 0.14), ('D', 0.07), ('E', 0.07), ('F', 0.04), ('G', 0.02), ('H', 0.02), ('I', 0.01)]
root = shannon_fano_encoding(symbol_probabilities)
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))
plot_tree(root)
plt.title("Shannon-Fano Encoding Tree")
plt.axis('off')
plt.show()
```



In this version, I added a check in the `plot_tree` function to verify if the node's value is not `None` before plotting the text. If the value is `None`, no text will be plotted for that node. This prevents "None" from being displayed in the plot.

You: 
- the node labels are also overlapping with the marker

ChatGPT: 
- To prevent the node labels from overlapping with the markers, you can adjust the position of the labels slightly. One approach is to increase the vertical offset of the labels. Here's how you can modify the `plot_tree` function to achieve that:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

class Node:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value
        self.left = None
        self.right = None

def shannon_fano_encoding(symbol_probabilities):
    sorted_symbols = sorted(symbol_probabilities, key=lambda x: x[1])  # Sort in ascending order
    return construct_tree(sorted_symbols)

def find_split_index(symbols, total_probability):
    cumulative_probability = 0
    split_index = 0
    min_difference = total_probability
    for i, (_, prob) in enumerate(symbols):
        cumulative_probability += prob
        difference = abs(2 * cumulative_probability - total_probability)
        if difference < min_difference:
            min_difference = difference
            split_index = i
    return split_index

def construct_tree(symbols):
    if len(symbols) == 1:
        return Node(symbols[0][0])  
    elif len(symbols) == 0:
        return None

    total_probability = sum(prob for _, prob in symbols)
    split_index = find_split_index(symbols, total_probability)

    node = Node(None)
    node.left = construct_tree(symbols[:split_index + 1])
    node.right = construct_tree(symbols[split_index + 1:])
    return node

def plot_tree(node, x=0, y=0, spacing=30):
    if node is not None:
        if node.value is not None:
            plt.text(x, y, str(node.value), style='italic', fontsize=14, verticalalignment='bottom', horizontalalignment='center')  # Adjust vertical alignment
        if node.left is not None:
            plt.plot([x, x - spacing], [y - 1, y - spacing], marker='o', color='b')
            plot_tree(node.left, x - spacing, y - spacing, spacing * 0.8)
        if node.right is not None:
            plt.plot([x, x + spacing], [y - 1, y - spacing], marker='o', color='b')
            plot_tree(node.right, x + spacing, y - spacing, spacing * 0.8)

# Example usage:
symbol_probabilities = [('A', 0.49), ('B', 0.14), ('C', 0.14), ('D', 0.07), ('E', 0.07), ('F', 0.04), ('G', 0.02), ('H', 0.02), ('I', 0.01)]

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))
plot_tree(root)
plt.title("Shannon-Fano Encoding Tree")
plt.axis('off')
plt.show()
```



In this version, I've adjusted the vertical alignment of the labels to `'bottom'` and horizontal alignment to `'center'` to position them slightly below the markers. This helps prevent overlap between the labels and the markers. You can further fine-tune the alignment and spacing as needed to improve the appearance of the plot.

        if node.value is not None:
            plt.text(x, y, str(node.value), style='normal', fontsize=18, verticalalignment='top', horizontalalignment='right')  # Adjust vertical alignment
        if node.left is not None:
            plt.plot([x, x - spacing], [y - 1, y - spacing], marker='o', color='b')
            plot_tree(node.left, x - spacing, y - spacing, spacing * 0.8)
        if node.right is not None:
            plt.plot([x, x + spacing], [y - 1, y - spacing], marker='o', color='r')
            plot_tree(node.right, x + spacing, y - spacing, spacing * 0.8)

# Example usage:
symbol_probabilities = [('A', 0.49), ('B', 0.14), ('C', 0.14), ('D', 0.07), ('E', 0.07), ('F', 0.04), ('G', 0.02), ('H', 0.02), ('I', 0.01)]
root = shannon_fano_encoding(symbol_probabilities)
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))
plot_tree(root)
plt.title("Shannon-Fano Encoding Tree")
plt.axis('off')
plt.show()

now I also want to include the encoding 0 and 1 in some way

ChatGPT: 
- To include the encoding `0` and `1` alongside the nodes in the plot, you can modify the `plot_tree` function to display the encoding paths as well. One common approach is to annotate the edges with the corresponding encoding symbols.

Here's how you can modify the `plot_tree` function to include the encoding paths:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

class Node:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value
        self.left = None
        self.right = None

def shannon_fano_encoding(symbol_probabilities):
    sorted_symbols = sorted(symbol_probabilities, key=lambda x: x[1])  # Sort in ascending order
    return construct_tree(sorted_symbols)

def find_split_index(symbols, total_probability):
    cumulative_probability = 0
    split_index = 0
    min_difference = total_probability
    for i, (_, prob) in enumerate(symbols):
        cumulative_probability += prob
        difference = abs(2 * cumulative_probability - total_probability)
        if difference < min_difference:
            min_difference = difference
            split_index = i
    return split_index

def construct_tree(symbols):
    if len(symbols) == 1:
        return Node(symbols[0][0])  
    elif len(symbols) == 0:
        return None

    total_probability = sum(prob for _, prob in symbols)
    split_index = find_split_index(symbols, total_probability)

    node = Node(None)
    node.left = construct_tree(symbols[:split_index + 1])
    node.right = construct_tree(symbols[split_index + 1:])
    return node

def plot_tree(node, x=0, y=0, spacing=30, code=''):
    if node is not None:
        if node.value is not None:
            plt.text(x, y, f"{node.value}\n{code}", style='normal', fontsize=14, verticalalignment='top', horizontalalignment='right')  # Adjust vertical alignment
        if node.left is not None:
            plt.plot([x, x - spacing], [y - 1, y - spacing], marker='o', color='b')
            plot_tree(node.left, x - spacing, y - spacing, spacing * 0.8, code + '0')
        if node.right is not None:
            plt.plot([x, x + spacing], [y - 1, y - spacing], marker='o', color='r')
            plot_tree(node.right, x + spacing, y - spacing, spacing * 0.8, code + '1')

# Example usage:
symbol_probabilities = [('A', 0.49), ('B', 0.14), ('C', 0.14), ('D', 0.07), ('E', 0.07), ('F', 0.04), ('G', 0.02), ('H', 0.02), ('I', 0.01)]
root = shannon_fano_encoding(symbol_probabilities)
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))
plot_tree(root)
plt.title("Shannon-Fano Encoding Tree")
plt.axis('off')
plt.show()
```



In this modified version of the `plot_tree` function, I added an additional parameter `code`, which keeps track of the encoding path from the root to the current node. This path is updated as the function traverses the tree recursively. The encoding path is then displayed alongside the node's value in the plot.

You: 
- seems fine, just a bit of overlap between labels and branches again

ChatGPT: 
- To reduce the overlap between labels and branches, you can adjust the positioning of the labels or increase the spacing between nodes. Since increasing the spacing between nodes might alter the overall appearance of the tree, let's focus on adjusting the positioning of the labels.

Here's a modified version of the `plot_tree` function where I've adjusted the vertical alignment of the labels to ensure they don't overlap with the branches:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

class Node:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value
        self.left = None
        self.right = None

def shannon_fano_encoding(symbol_probabilities):
    sorted_symbols = sorted(symbol_probabilities, key=lambda x: x[1])  # Sort in ascending order
    return construct_tree(sorted_symbols)

def find_split_index(symbols, total_probability):
    cumulative_probability = 0
    split_index = 0
    min_difference = total_probability
    for i, (_, prob) in enumerate(symbols):
        cumulative_probability += prob
        difference = abs(2 * cumulative_probability - total_probability)
        if difference < min_difference:
            min_difference = difference
            split_index = i
    return split_index

def construct_tree(symbols):
    if len(symbols) == 1:
        return Node(symbols[0][0])  
    elif len(symbols) == 0:
        return None

    total_probability = sum(prob for _, prob in symbols)
    split_index = find_split_index(symbols, total_probability)

    node = Node(None)
    node.left = construct_tree(symbols[:split_index + 1])
    node.right = construct_tree(symbols[split_index + 1:])
    return node

def plot_tree(node, x=0, y=0, spacing=30, code=''):
    if node is not None:
        if node.value is not None:
            plt.text(x, y - 1, f"{node.value}\n{code}", style='normal', fontsize=14, verticalalignment='top', horizontalalignment='center')  # Adjust vertical alignment
        if node.left is not None:
            plt.plot([x, x - spacing], [y - 2, y - spacing], marker='o', color='b')
            plot_tree(node.left, x - spacing, y - spacing, spacing * 0.8, code + '0')
        if node.right is not None:
            plt.plot([x, x + spacing], [y - 2, y - spacing], marker='o', color='r')
            plot_tree(node.right, x + spacing, y - spacing, spacing * 0.8, code + '1')

# Example usage:
symbol_probabilities = [('A', 0.49), ('B', 0.14), ('C', 0.14), ('D', 0.07), ('E', 0.07), ('F', 0.04), ('G', 0.02), ('H', 0.02), ('I', 0.01)]
root = shannon_fano_encoding(symbol_probabilities)
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))
plot_tree(root)
plt.title("Shannon-Fano Encoding Tree")
plt.axis('off')
plt.show()
```



In this version, I've adjusted the vertical alignment of the labels to `'top'` and shifted the y-coordinate by -1 to ensure that the labels are positioned above the branches. This should help reduce overlap between labels and branches. You can further adjust the spacing and positioning as needed to optimize the layout of the tree.

You: 
- alright give me some test cases to check the program

ChatGPT: 
- Here are a few test cases to check the program: 
1. **Equal probabilities for all symbols** :

```python
symbol_probabilities = [('A', 0.2), ('B', 0.2), ('C', 0.2), ('D', 0.2), ('E', 0.2)]
``` 
2. **Unequal probabilities** :

```python
symbol_probabilities = [('A', 0.4), ('B', 0.3), ('C', 0.2), ('D', 0.1)]
``` 
3. **Single symbol** :

```python
symbol_probabilities = [('A', 1.0)]
``` 
4. **Two symbols with equal probabilities** :

```python
symbol_probabilities = [('A', 0.5), ('B', 0.5)]
``` 
5. **Two symbols with different probabilities** :

```python
symbol_probabilities = [('A', 0.7), ('B', 0.3)]
``` 
6. **Large number of symbols** :

```python
symbol_probabilities = [('A', 0.1), ('B', 0.05), ('C', 0.03), ('D', 0.02), ('E', 0.01)] * 10
```

You can use these test cases to verify that the program generates the Shannon-Fano encoding tree correctly and that the tree plot is visually accurate.

    [('A', 0.4), ('B', 0.3), ('C', 0.2), ('D', 0.1)],
    [('A', 0.5), ('B', 0.5)],
    [('A', 0.7), ('B', 0.3)]
]
```



You can iterate over these test cases to check the program's behavior with different input scenarios.
